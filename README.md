# CSCI-B351-Final
# We have five Classifier :
    one unsupervised( Cluster)
    four supervised(NeuralNetwork Classifier, KNN Classifier, Perceptron Classifier, RandomForest Classifier)
# please use python-64bits to run , since tensorflow only available on that
# Run DataCollection you will get what is the accuracy for each algorithm
# Run Visualization you will get the idea about what is our dataset, as well as our accuracy graph and time graph
