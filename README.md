# CSCI-B351-Final
This is the project for CSCI-B351 Intro to AI Finals and attributed to Tao and Wang.
We have five Classifier :
    one unsupervised (Cluster)
    four supervised(NeuralNetwork Classifier, KNN Classifier, Perceptron Classifier, RandomForest Classifier)
please use python-64bits to run , since tensorflow only available on that
Run DataCollection you will get what is the accuracy and time status for each algorithm
Run Visualization you will get the idea about what is our dataset, as well as our accuracy graph and time graph
